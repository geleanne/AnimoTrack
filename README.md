# AnimoTrack

**AnimoTrack** is a mobile app for DLSU students to stay updated on campus events. It allows users to view, join, and check into university activities, addressing the common issue of missed announcements on social media. By centralizing event details, the app ensures students never miss out on campus-led or student-led programs.
